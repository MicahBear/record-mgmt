## What are we building?

A record management,weather history livestock operations,field operations, production, and sourcing to filing for third party certifications. Farmers are tasked with managing their records from fields for production, raising livestock and records for sourcing feed, sales to vendors, and tasks in the field that relate to certifications.

## Iterations

I will start with a working MVP and go from there. The scope and order of iterations is _subject to change!_

1. **MVP:** Simple calender api and weather api for record of weather and tasks. Store that data for reference in the future.
2. **User Login**
3. **Dash Board**
4. **Upload files for storage and correlate to databased based on operations**
5. **Edit files**
6. **Assign tasks- record for reference in future**
7. **Update README when development reaches this point.**
